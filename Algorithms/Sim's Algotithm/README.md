# Schreier–Sims algorithm


The Schreier–Sims algorithm is an algorithm in computational group theory, named after the mathematicians Otto Schreier and Charles Sims. This algorithm can find the order of a finite permutation group, test membership (is a given permutation contained in a group?), and other tasks in polynomial time. It was introduced by Sims in 1970, based on Schreier's subgroup lemma. The running time was subsequently improved by Donald Knuth in 1991. Later, an even faster randomized version of the algorithm was developed.
